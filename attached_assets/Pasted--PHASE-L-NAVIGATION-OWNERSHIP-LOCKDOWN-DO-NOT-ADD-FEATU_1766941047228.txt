🔒 PHASE L — NAVIGATION & OWNERSHIP LOCKDOWN
DO NOT ADD FEATURES. DO NOT TOUCH BUSINESS LOGIC. DO NOT MODIFY DATABASE SCHEMA.
This patch is UI + routing only.
Goal: Make the UI tell the truth about the system.
🎯 OBJECTIVE
Eliminate confusion by enforcing canonical ownership in the sidebar and navigation.
After this patch:
Every visible menu item has one clear owner
Legacy / duplicate systems are hidden, not deleted
Users can tell where to go without prior knowledge
🚫 ABSOLUTE RULES
The agent MUST NOT:
Add new pages
Add new logic
Change backend behavior
Change APIs or schemas
Re-architect anything
This is REMOVE / HIDE / RENAME / LOCK ONLY.
✅ REQUIRED OUTCOMES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1️⃣ PURCHASING OWNS ALL STOCK (VISUALLY)
REMOVE from Finance
❌ “Lodge Stock Purchase”
❌ Any UI text implying items/quantities belong to Finance
Finance = numbers only
ENSURE under Purchasing
✅ Purchasing List
✅ Manual Stock Purchase
✅ Purchasing Log (rename from “Shift Log” if still present)
✅ Shopping List
Action
Update sidebar config (ModernSidebar.tsx, Sidebar.tsx)
Remove stock-related navigation from Finance
Ensure Purchasing section contains all stock workflows
2️⃣ REMOVE F&B ANALYSIS FROM NAVIGATION
Context
F&B Analysis duplicates Ingredient Reconciliation
Ingredient Reconciliation is the truth view
Actions
❌ Remove “F&B Analysis” from sidebar navigation
❌ Remove any submenu references
DO NOT delete the page
Page may remain accessible by direct URL
This is a visibility lock, not a deletion
3️⃣ DECLARE ONE MENU AUTHORITY
CANONICAL (VISIBLE)
✅ Recipe Management
✅ Menu Manager (only if still actively used)
LEGACY (HIDDEN FROM SIDEBAR)
❌ Menu Master V3
❌ Menu Admin
Actions
Remove legacy menu tools from sidebar
If accessed directly:
Show read-only banner (already exists)
Do NOT block access
Sidebar must show one menu entry point only
4️⃣ REMOVE INGREDIENT MASTER FROM SIDEBAR
Rule
Ingredients are derived from Purchasing, not a standalone system.
Actions
❌ Remove “Ingredient Master / Ingredient Mgmt” from sidebar
Ingredients remain accessible only via:
Purchasing List
Recipe Management flows
5️⃣ FINAL SIDEBAR STRUCTURE (MUST MATCH EXACTLY)
After this patch, the sidebar must read:
