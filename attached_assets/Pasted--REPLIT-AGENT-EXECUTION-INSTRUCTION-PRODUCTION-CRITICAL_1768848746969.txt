🔴 REPLIT AGENT — EXECUTION INSTRUCTION (PRODUCTION-CRITICAL)
Objective
Restore Menu and Ordering to a correct, live, production-ready state without creating a new Replit, fixing routing, visibility, and UI duplication issues introduced during recent merges.
1️⃣ ROUTING & UI FIXES (MANDATORY)
Ensure Menu Manager renders once only (no nested layout, no duplicated headers/nav bars).
Confirm /menu/manager is the single canonical menu management route.
Remove or bypass any legacy wrapper/layout that causes:
Double headers
Double bottom navigation
Blank page with duplicated nav bars
Acceptance criteria
/menu/manager loads content
Single header
Single bottom nav
No 404
2️⃣ NAVIGATION ALIGNMENT
Update all navigation entry points to target /menu/manager:
Sidebar
ModernSidebar
BottomNav
Any legacy recipe/menu links
There must be no remaining links to:
/recipe-management
deprecated menu or recipe admin routes
3️⃣ ORDER PAGE DATA ISSUE (CRITICAL)
The /order page is not reflecting current active products.
Fix the product feed so that:
All products marked active = true
With valid pricing
With valid channel visibility
are returned to /order.
⚠️ This is NOT a UI issue — this is a data eligibility / filtering bug.
Do NOT:
Reintroduce recipe coupling
Add fallback pricing
Guess defaults
Products must appear only if valid, but all valid products must appear.
4️⃣ NO GIT / NO PR / NO REPO RESETS
Do NOT reset the repo
Do NOT create new branches
Do NOT revert merged PRs
Do NOT create a new Replit
This is a surgical fix on current main state.
5️⃣ DATABASE & ENVIRONMENT
Assume DATABASE_URL exists in Replit secrets
Do NOT modify schema
Do NOT reseed data
Do NOT run destructive scripts
6️⃣ FINAL VERIFICATION (REQUIRED)
Confirm these URLs work:
/menu/manager
Content visible
No duplicate UI
/order
Shows all active products, not a subset
Bottom nav → Menu
Lands on /menu/manager
7️⃣ STOP CONDITION
Once complete:
Do NOT continue refactoring
Do NOT optimize
Do NOT “clean up” unrelated files
Report only:
What was changed
Which files were touched
Confirmation that all three URLs work
Priority: 🔥 LIVE TOMORROW
Mode: FIX & STABILIZE
No interpretation. No redesign. No expansion.
