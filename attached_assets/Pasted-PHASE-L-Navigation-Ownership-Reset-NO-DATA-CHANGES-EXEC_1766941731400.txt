PHASE L — Navigation & Ownership Reset (NO DATA CHANGES)
EXECUTION MODE: READ / HIDE / REDIRECT ONLY
ABSOLUTE RULES
❌ DO NOT change schemas
❌ DO NOT change data, calculations, or analysis logic
❌ DO NOT add features
❌ DO NOT delete routes or files
✅ ONLY update sidebar navigation, labels, visibility, and redirects
✅ HIDE ≠ DELETE (routes must remain accessible if directly visited)
🎯 OBJECTIVE
Restore clarity, ownership, and trust in the UI by enforcing one clear home per responsibility.
The system already has repaired truth (K-phases).
Phase L fixes how humans experience the system.
