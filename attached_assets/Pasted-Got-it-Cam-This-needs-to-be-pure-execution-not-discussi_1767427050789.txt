Got it, Cam. This needs to be pure execution, not discussion. Below is exactly what you asked for:
PATCH 1.6.16 — Recipe Completion via Canonical Ingredient Model
Purpose (non-negotiable):
Fully populate recipes using the corrected economic model:
Purchasing = packs / cartons / kg / boxes (unit cost lives here)
Recipes = portions consumed per item (grams, pieces, spoons)
NO purchasing prices or pack sizes inside recipes
Recipe cost = derived ONLY via ingredient → purchasing linkage
This patch only adds recipes + ingredients.
No schema changes. No pricing logic changes.
✅ CANONICAL RULES (LOCKED)
Recipe quantities = portion usage only
Units allowed in recipes
grams
pieces
slices
spoons (treated as grams via ingredient config)
Do NOT enter pack sizes in recipes
Do NOT enter costs in recipes
All ingredients must already exist in ingredients
All ingredients must already be linked to purchasing_items
