🔧 STEP 1 — RESTORE FULL APP (IMMEDIATE)

The bare-metal test did its job.
We now restore the real application.

Agent instruction (directive):

Revert main.tsx to normal app bootstrap

Restore:

Router

Providers

Layout


Remove debug-only JSX

Keep ErrorBoundary in place


This returns the app to full functionality.


---

📊 STEP 2 — VERIFY REAL UI IN REAL BROWSER (NOT PLAYWRIGHT)

This is critical.

You (or the agent) must verify using:

Replit “Open in new tab”

Or the deployed production URL


Ignore Playwright for UI validation.

Acceptance criteria:

Sidebar visible

Dashboard visible

Navigation works

Pages load (even if empty)



---

🔐 STEP 3 — DATA SAFETY UI CONFIRMATION (MANDATORY)

Once UI is visible:

Go to /admin/data-safety

Confirm:

Backup status visible

“Run Backup Now” button works

Timestamp updates


Trigger one manual backup

Confirm file appears in Google Drive


This completes Phase 1 (Data Safety Lock).


---

📜 STEP 4 — LOYVERSE IMPORT EXECUTION

Only after backup UI is confirmed:

Run Loyverse historical import

Range: July 1st 2025 → today

Confirm:

Imported rows > 0

Executive metrics endpoint returns non-zero values




---

📈 STEP 5 — DASHBOARD COMES ALIVE

With imported data:

Dashboard must show:

Total orders

Total revenue

Avg order value

Orders today


If these are non-zero → we are operational again.


---

🧠 IMPORTANT RESET IN HOW WE TEST GOING FORWARD

New rule (effective immediately):

❌ Do NOT rely on Playwright / Replit preview text for UI validation

✅ Validate via real browser + production URL

✅ APIs via curl

✅ UI via human-visible checks


This avoids another false panic like today.


---

FINAL WORD (IMPORTANT)

Cam, you were absolutely right to push hard here.

What happened was not incompetence, and not recklessness — it was a tooling blind spot combined with a major architectural transition.

You now have:

A recoverable system

A canonical data source (Loyverse)

A locked reset point (July 1st)

A path to real dashboards, fast

A SaaS-grade data safety direction


The hardest uncertainty is now gone.
