🔒 DO NOT — NON-NEGOTIABLE (READ FIRST)

DO NOT touch, reset, truncate, migrate, or re-seed any database tables

DO NOT run prisma migrate reset, db push --force, or any destructive command

DO NOT modify schemas, models, or data services

DO NOT add new features, patches, or refactors

DO NOT rely on Playwright, Replit Preview status pages, or “Running” banners for validation

DO NOT leave debug pages, debug text, or temporary boot code in production

DO NOT proceed past a step unless the acceptance criteria is visibly confirmed in a real browser


This patch is frontend-only and data-safe by design.

🔧 PATCH UI-BOOT-RESTORE — FULL APPLICATION BOOTSTRAP RESTORATION

OBJECTIVE (NO DEVIATION)

Restore the full React application bootstrap so that:

The app actually mounts

The sidebar, routes, and real UI render

/admin/data-safety is visible and usable

All debug scaffolding is completely removed


Right now the system is:

> ✅ Backend working
❌ Frontend not mounting



This patch fixes only that.


---

STEP 1 — REMOVE ALL DEBUG / TEMPORARY CODE (MANDATORY)

Files to clean:

client/src/main.tsx

REMOVE any of the following if present:

REACT BOOT OK

Hardcoded <div>Running</div>

Temporary JSX renders

Console-only test renders


RESTORE standard bootstrap:


import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

const root = document.getElementById("root");
if (!root) throw new Error("Root element not found");

createRoot(root).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);


---

client/src/pages/admin/DebugPage.tsx

DELETE THIS FILE



---

client/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx

DELETE if it was added only for debugging
(We will reintroduce error boundaries later in a controlled patch)



---

STEP 2 — RESTORE FULL APP BOOTSTRAP (NO SHORTCUTS)

client/src/App.tsx

Must include all real providers and routing, for example:

Router (BrowserRouter)

App shell / layout

Sidebar / navigation

Existing routes:

/

/admin/data-safety

POS

KDS

Menu V3

Finance / Operations pages



Do not gate routes. Do not use Suspense fallback text like "Running".

If Suspense is required, fallback must be a visible UI component, e.g.:

<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading application…</div>}>


---

STEP 3 — VERIFY STATIC BUILD & SERVING (NO GUESSING)

The agent must explicitly verify:

1. Build output exists

dist/public/index.html

dist/public/assets/*.js



2. HTML contains

<div id="root"></div>
<script type="module" src="/assets/xxxx.js"></script>


3. Server static path

Express / server must serve exactly dist/public

No other static folders



4. JS bundle loads

Open browser devtools → Network → confirm JS loads with 200

No red errors in Console





---

STEP 4 — REAL BROWSER VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)

Using the actual Replit deployed URL (not Playwright):

Must visually confirm:

Sidebar renders

Navigation links visible

/admin/data-safety shows:

Backup status

Backup run button

Historical import controls


Dashboard shows numbers, not empty placeholders


If the page shows only “Running”: ➡️ STOP IMMEDIATELY ➡️ Report which file reintroduced it


---

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (ALL REQUIRED)

✅ React mounts (no blank screen)

✅ Sidebar visible

✅ Routes navigate

✅ /admin/data-safety usable

✅ No debug text anywhere

✅ Zero database changes

✅ Zero data loss



---

STOP CONDITIONS (ABSOLUTE)

The agent must STOP and report if:

“Running” appears again

React does not mount

JS bundle not executed

Any temptation to “just refactor” appears



---

CONTEXT (FOR AGENT)

Backend systems (Backup, Loyverse Import, Metrics) are already complete

This patch is purely UI boot restoration

Investor demo and live business depend on this being solid

Data safety is paramount — frontend failure is acceptable, data loss is not
