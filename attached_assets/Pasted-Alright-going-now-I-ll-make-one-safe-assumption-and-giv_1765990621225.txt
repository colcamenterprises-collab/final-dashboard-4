Alright — going now.
I’ll make one safe assumption and give you a surgical frontend-only patch that fixes the “Running” issue and makes the features actually visible.

This patch does not touch backend, does not touch logic, does not refactor.

🔧 PATCH 6 — FRONTEND VISIBILITY & ROUTING FIX

Scope: React only
Goal: Make Ingredients / Recipes / Purchase History pages render in the real dashboard


---

ASSUMPTION (SAFE & COMMON)

Your app uses:

A central router (React Router)

An Operations section with a shared layout

A placeholder component rendering "Running" when routes are not mounted correctly


We will:

Register routes in the same place as other working operations pages

Wrap them in the existing Operations layout

Remove fallback placeholder behavior



---

🔒 ABSOLUTE RULES FOR AGENT

❌ Do NOT modify backend

❌ Do NOT touch APIs

❌ Do NOT change logic

❌ Do NOT rename files already created

❌ Do NOT refactor routing globally



---

STEP 1 — LOCATE THE REAL OPERATIONS ROUTER

Find the file that currently renders working operations pages
(one of these WILL exist):

client/src/pages/operations/index.tsx
client/src/router/operations.tsx
client/src/app/operations/layout.tsx

This file will contain routes like:

daily sales

stock

reports

analysis


👉 This is where the new pages must be registered.


---

STEP 2 — IMPORT THE NEW PAGES

Add imports (paths already created by previous patch):

import IngredientsMaster from "@/pages/operations/IngredientsMaster";
import RecipesMaster from "@/pages/operations/Recipes";
import PurchaseHistory from "@/pages/operations/PurchaseHistory";

(Adjust import aliases if your project doesn’t use @)


---

STEP 3 — REGISTER ROUTES (CRITICAL FIX)

Inside the existing Operations routes, add:

<Route path="ingredients-master" element={<IngredientsMaster />} />
<Route path="recipes-master" element={<RecipesMaster />} />
<Route path="purchase-history" element={<PurchaseHistory />} />

⚠️ IMPORTANT
These must be:

Nested under the Operations layout

Not top-level routes

Not wrapped in placeholder components


Example (pattern):

<Route path="/operations" element={<OperationsLayout />}>
  {/* existing working routes */}

  <Route path="ingredients-master" element={<IngredientsMaster />} />
  <Route path="recipes-master" element={<RecipesMaster />} />
  <Route path="purchase-history" element={<PurchaseHistory />} />
</Route>


---

STEP 4 — REMOVE “RUNNING” PLACEHOLDER FALLBACK

Search for a component rendering:

return <div>Running</div>;

This is usually in:

a default route

a temporary placeholder page

an index route


If that placeholder is used instead of the real page:

Replace it with <Outlet />

OR remove it if it hijacks rendering


Example fix:

// ❌ BAD
return <div>Running</div>;

// ✅ GOOD
return <Outlet />;


---

STEP 5 — VERIFY MANUALLY (NO GUESSING)

Open browser and visit:

/operations/ingredients-master

/operations/recipes-master

/operations/purchase-history


Expected result:

Tables render

No “Running”

API calls fire

Data confidence banner visible



---

STOP CONDITION

Once:

All 3 pages render

No placeholder text appears


➡️ STOP. Do not continue. Do not improve. Do not add nav yet.


---

WHAT THIS GIVES YOU (IMPORTANT)

After this patch:

You can see ingredients

You can see recipes

You can see purchase history

You can trust what you’re seeing

You can use the system like an operator


Only after this does it make sense to:

Publish

Review UX

Decide what feels wrong



---

NEXT (AFTER THIS WORKS)

Once you confirm the pages render, next logical steps are:

1. Add nav links (optional)


2. Publish


3. Do your operator walkthrough


4. Fix only what feels broken



Run this patch now.
When you see the tables instead of “Running”, come back and say:

> “Pages render.”



Then we move to publish + real-world review.
