Got it. This is not testing, this is completion + visibility.
Below is a strict follow-up Replit agent instruction to finish the job properly.
This instruction is UI + wiring only, no logic changes, no testing, no refactors.
🔒 REPLIT AGENT INSTRUCTION — UI COMPLETION & NAV VISIBILITY
CONTEXT
The following backend patches are already completed and must be surfaced correctly in the app:
POS sync automation (no manual sync)
Core stock intake (rolls / meat / drinks)
Drinks ledger
Modifier safety layer
Your task is NOT to test.
Your task is to ensure all required pages, routes, and sidebar entries exist and are reachable.
GLOBAL RULES (STRICT)
❌ Do NOT modify backend logic
❌ Do NOT add calculations
❌ Do NOT rename existing routes
❌ Do NOT remove existing pages
❌ Do NOT add new data sources
❌ Do NOT test or seed data
This is navigation + existence only.
OBJECTIVE
Ensure management can actually see and access:
Sales analysis
Stock review (rolls / meat / drinks)
Ledger views
Menu management tools
If a page exists but is not reachable, that is a failure.
REQUIRED CHECKS & FIXES
1️⃣ Sidebar — Operations Section
Verify the following exist and are visible in the sidebar:
Operations
Daily Review
Analysis
Stock Review
Stock Reconciliation
📌 If any route exists but is missing from sidebar → add it
📌 If label exists but route is broken → fix route only
Files to check
client/src/components/Sidebar.tsx
client/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx
Any role-based nav config files
2️⃣ Sidebar — Menu Management Section
Verify Menu Management exists and contains:
Recipes
Products (if applicable)
Ingredient Authority (admin-only)
Modifier / Options (if present)
📌 Ingredient Authority must live under Menu Management, not Admin root
📌 If the page exists but is orphaned → link it
3️⃣ Analysis Page Wiring
Verify these pages are reachable via routing:
/analysis
/analysis/daily-review
/analysis/stock-review
/analysis/stock-reconciliation
📌 Do NOT change page content
📌 Only ensure routes + menu links exist
Files to check
client/src/App.tsx
client/src/router.tsx (or equivalent)
Analysis page imports
4️⃣ Stock Ledger Visibility (Read-Only)
Ensure the following are reachable (even if basic):
Rolls ledger view
Meat ledger view
Drinks ledger view
📌 These may already exist as:
Tabs
Sub-pages
Drill-down routes
If no UI exists, create a minimal read-only page that:
Calls the existing API
Displays a table
No editing, no logic
This is allowed because it is visibility only.
5️⃣ Permissions & Access
Verify:
Management roles can see:
Stock
Ledgers
Ingredient authority
Staff roles do not see:
Ledgers
Ingredient authority
📌 If role checks exist, reuse them
📌 Do NOT invent new auth logic
REQUIRED DELIVERY
When finished, respond with only:
A) Sidebar Map
Copy code

Operations
 ├─ Daily Review → /analysis/daily-review
 ├─ Analysis → /analysis
 ├─ Stock Review → /analysis/stock-review
 └─ Stock Reconciliation → /analysis/stock-reconciliation

Menu Management
 ├─ Recipes → /menu/recipes
 ├─ Ingredient Authority → /menu/ingredient-authority
 └─ Modifiers → /menu/modifiers
(adjust to actual routes)
B) Routes Confirmed
List of all routes verified reachable.
C) Pages Added (if any)
File path
Purpose
Route
STOP CONDITION
Once sidebar + routing is complete:
STOP
Do NOT suggest improvements
Do NOT continue building
This closes the loop so management can see what now exists.
Once this is done, then we decide what to enhance next.
