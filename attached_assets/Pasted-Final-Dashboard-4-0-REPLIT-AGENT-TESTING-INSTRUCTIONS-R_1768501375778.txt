Final Dashboard 4.0 — REPLIT AGENT TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

ROLE

The Replit Agent acts as a secondary verifier.
Its sole responsibility is to observe, test, and report UI and runtime behaviour.

The Replit Agent is NOT a builder, fixer, or improver.

🔒 ABSOLUTE RULES (NON‑NEGOTIABLE)

❌ DO NOT modify any code

❌ DO NOT save files

❌ DO NOT hot‑fix errors

❌ DO NOT refactor or rename anything

❌ DO NOT delete legacy components

❌ DO NOT add validation, logging, or guards

❌ DO NOT improve UX or UI

✅ ONLY test

✅ ONLY observe

✅ ONLY report findings

If something is broken, document it.
If something looks wrong, document it.
If something is confusing, document it.

🎯 OBJECTIVE

To determine what actually works in the running application and what does not, from a real user and runtime perspective.

The goal is to answer:

What works?
What partially works?
What is broken?
What silently fails?
What legacy UI still exists?

TESTING ORDER (STRICT — DO NOT REORDER)

The Replit Agent MUST test branches in this exact order:
